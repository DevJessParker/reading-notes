# Operators and Loop

## Assignment Operators

Assigns a value on the left operand based on the value on the right operand.

- An example is x = y
> This can be understood as "y" can be replace by or referred to be "x"

## Comparison Operators

- An example is x != y
> This can be understood as "x" is NOT equal to "y"

## Loops

Loops are funtion tasks that can double-back on themselves based on certain parameters.

### Types of Loops

- For loop
> Used when you know a specified number of times you want to run the loop.

- While loop
> Runs until certain conditions are met.
