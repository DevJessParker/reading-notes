## Functions, Methods, and Objects

### Key Terms
----- | -----
property | a variable inside an object
method | a function used in conjunction with the object
key | name + value
constructor method | a line-by-line function that uses methods to create MULTIPLE objects
literal notation | a line-by-line vertical listing of keys that creates ONE object

A key cannot have more than one name within an object.
You can have arrays of objects, but you can also have arrays *within* objects.
