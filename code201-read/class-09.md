# Lists, Tables, and Forms

## Steps of a Form

- User submits information
- Server processes input and stores it in a database
- Server creates a new page to display information

Terms | Definition
----- | -----
action attribute | page URL that will display user input
maxlength | allow a user to only enter a certain number of characters
password | creates box that blacks out the text entry
textarea | multi-line text input
radio button | users can choose one from a certain number of answers
checkbox | users can choose many from a certain number of answers
drop down box | drop down list - one option
multiple select | allows multiple options to be selected by user
file input | user can upload a file
submit button | sends form to server
image | can set height/width/alt src info
hidden | allows the form to contain hidden info for the developer's use
fieldset | a sort of div that groups form controls
label | used to label the form for screen readers
legend | identifies header/use of form



Two Form Methods:
- Get: information that does not need to be stored in a database.
- Post: forms that allows a user to upload, or long forms, or forms that contain sensitive userdata.

### Concepts:

- Forms have unique CSS attributes
- Vertical alignment is best
- Users like interactive forms
