# CSS Layout (Part II)

## General Concepts

- inline elements exist between text.
-parent elements are divs or elements that contain other content
-positioning schemes are:

Scheme | Abstract
----- | -----
normal flow | all block elements appear on new line
relative | moves an element from the normal flow, relative to its original position
fixed position | things are placed in an absolute location in relation to the actual browser window
floating | taking an element out of the normal flow and putting it at the far left or right
z-index | The "back to front" position of an element

## Layouts

Layout | Abstract
----- | -----
fixed layout | measured in exact pixels
liquid | use percentages to stretch and adjust to screen size.
