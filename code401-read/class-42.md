# Ethics in Tech

Reflections:

**Amazon and Face Recognition Software**

Amazon is such a megolith when it comes to data aggregation, and the idea of handing over the future of immigration safety to a place that also sells sneakers is bizarre. I can see how there would be several ethical questions arising from facial recognition used at the border, and then also used to "hunt" down migrant workers, illegal immigrants, and asylum seekers in the US. I also like how this article talked about "internal activism" within tech companies, and how employees have the power to stand up and demand change in the tech landscape.

**Ethical Dilemma of Self-Driving Cars**

This was such an interesting article, which asked the question: "Who should self-driving cars save in the event that a collision is unavoidable?"

I don't think I'd really considered this question before, which is a bit shocking because there are so many self-driving Tesla cars where I live. We're reaching a point (and we already have in many military tech fields) where human life is being delegated to the judgement of AI. This terrifies me.

This article also talked about the "social adjustment" that happens regarding user comfort level and new tech, in the same way much of society felt uncomfortable about cell phones initially.
