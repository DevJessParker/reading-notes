# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML Lists

&nbsp;


### Key Terms

&nbsp;

Term | Definition
----- | -----
ul | A list that does not depend on numerical order
ol | A number list that depends on numerical order, such as a how-to article
dl | a list where a definition is linked to a term, such as this list
dt | contains the term of the dl
li | contains an item of the ul or ol

&nbsp;

Note: There can be a subset of a list within a larger list. You can also mix types of lists between the parent list and the subset.

&nbsp;

## CSS Box Model

&nbsp;

### Key Terms

Term | Definition
----- | -----
border | the outermost edge of a given box. Can be visible or invisible.
margin | The space or gap created between one box and nearby boxes.
padding | The space created *within* a box, between its contents and its border
white space | space provided between blocks of content that help with readability


&nbsp;

### Key Concepts

&nbsp;

- To center a box, be sure to set a width.
- IE6 has its own display properties/requirements as an older browser.
- You can toggle the visibility of a box, but the content can still be read by the end user via the "Inspect" or source in their browser.
- There is a difference between block versus inline boxes.

&nbsp;


## JS Control Flow

&nbsp;

### Key Terms

&nbsp;

Term | Definition
----- | -----
switch statment | begins with a *switch value*. Specific statments are executed only if they match the *switch value*.
type coercion | A built-in feature that prompts JS to attempt to interpret a typing error
weak typing | when data type for a declared value can change
strong typing | the need to specify which exact data type each variable will be
falsy | values approached as if they are FALSE (number 0)
truthy | values approached as if they are TRUE (number 1)
loops | a code block that will circle on itself until conditions are met or it returns a true.
loop counters | a condition that tracks the number of times a loop has been performed.



&nbsp;

### Key Concepts

&nbsp;

- Switch statements can be faster to execute compared to *if* statements, because each statment is not read exactly in order. Only the statements that match the *switch value* are read.
- Infinite loops are bad
- There are *for* loops, *while* loops, and *do while* loops
