# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

In this module, we'll introduce terms and concepts that form the foundation of how users access the web, as well as how websites and digital content rely on markup languages to organize and display web-based information.

&nbsp;


## How Websites Work

### Key Terms

Term | Definition
------------ | ------------
web browser | Software used to access a website.
web server | A computer that hosts a website (or websites).
web hosting | A process by which a company rents server space.
DNS server | A computer that tells a browser where to find the appropriate host server.
screen readers | Programs that convert websites into audio-friendly content, often used by users with visual impairments.

&nbsp;

When a user visits a website within their web browser, the browser contacts a DNS server, which directs that browser to the web host. The host sends back HTML and CSS to the browser, which then presents the information based on the programmed style and content.

## Introduction to HTML

### Key Terms

Term | Definition
------------ | ------------
HTML | Hypertext Markup Language
markup language | A computer language with rules and syntax that helps group and organize content.
elements | A block of information or content contained within two HTML tags.
tags | HTML code that typically begins with an open bracket and ends with a closing bracket: ```<p>This example is a paragraph element using paragraph tags.</p>```
attributes | Additional information applied to an element.
name | A portion of the attribute that describes the *what*
value | The second portion of the attribute that describes the *which*

&nbsp;

HTML is a language used to create a text-based document that lists and groups information which will be displayed in a web browser. This language utilizes tags consisting of open and closing brackets which group the information into elements. (The word tag and element are often used interchangeably.) These elements can also be assigned attributes, which are additional conditions and values which can affect what is contained within the element.

&nbsp;

## HTML Extra Markup Concepts

Term | Definition
------------ | ------------
DOCTYPES | Tells browsers which version of HTML you are using. The most current version of HTML is HTML5.
comments | Add comments using the ```<!--Add comment here-->``` This information will not be displayed by the browser.
id attribute | Assigns a unique id to that element
class attribute | Groups similar elements. The same CSS can then be applied to these groups.
block-level elements | Begin on news lines in HTML code. The containers in which information is grouped.
inline elements | HTML code used within a line of a neighboring element. These can affect certain words or bits of information within a larger block of content.
```<div> and <span>``` | Tags that can be used to group block-level and inline elements together.
```<meta>``` | Tag that contains additional information about your webpage. This information is not displayed by the browser.
escape character | Special HTML text used to display special characters, such as a copyright symbol, on your webpage. 

&nbsp;

HTML can seem daunting at first, but it is important to remember that this language follows a set list of rules used to group information. By using the id and class attributes, we can tell a browser whether or not an element is unique or should be considered similar to another element. By using ```<div> and <span>```, we can group different types of HTML into the same container. Extra markup can also be used to provide additional meta information used in SEO.

## HTML5 and Layout

### Key Terms

Term | Definition
----- | -----
HTML5 | The most current version of HTML

&nbsp;

HTML5 introduced elements that allow users to divide parts of a page. These new divisions include ```<header>```, ```<nav>```, ```<article>```, and ```<footer>```. HTML5 requires JavaScript to work in older browsers (versions prior to IE 8).

## Process and Design of an HTML webpage

### Key Terms

Term | Definition
----- | -----
site map | A structure of how related pages will be structured within the same website.
wireframe | A necessary step in the development of a webpage. This serves as the "roadmap" for how digital content will be group and presented to an end user.
card sorting | A technique by which you can manually write down information about each page and organize them to better visually understand the website structure.
visual heirarchy | The order that an eye perceives or "reads" information
visual contrast | A graphic design concept used to differentiate between items to create clear visual distinctions between the information presented.

&nbsp;

A necessary part of web design is understanding the user and ***why/how they intend to use a website.*** By understanding this motivation, information can be grouped and displayed appropriately for the user to better consume the digital content. 
&nbsp;

## Introduction to JavaScript

### Key Terms

Term | Definition
----- | -----
debugging | The process of finding out what went wrong within the code.
programmatic | The way a computer resolves instructions, in order, one after the other.
script | A series of instructions used to direct computers toward a goal or outcome
&nbsp;

JavaScript is often used in web pages to make websites more interactive. It is written within HTML using the ```<script></script>``` tags, and describes a set order of tasks for a computer to complete when processing information and/or user inputs.
