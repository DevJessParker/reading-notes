# React Recap

- How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
  - Meet with a designer and try to unify naming conventions.
  - Create a wireframe.
  - 

- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

  - The idea that components should only do one thing, for optimization, flexibility in code, and speed.

- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
  - This renders your wireframe with no user interactivity.

- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
  - State

- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
  - Is the data passed through parent by props?
  - Does it remain static?
  - Can you compute the data based on anything else in your component?

- How can you identify where state needs to live? If N -> not state
