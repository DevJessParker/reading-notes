# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript


JavaScript is used to perform content that can dynamically update based on inputs and conditions. This is NOT the same as the Java programming language.

## Input

An input is a defined variable.

## Output

An output is the result.

## String

Operations based on text inputs. If a number is surrounded by '2' it will be considered a string.

## Variables

Identifiers given a certain value. Must be identified with certain reference name.

## To declare a variable

```
let x = 2
```

x is the variable
let is the signal that the value will be declared



JavaScript, html, and css files can all interact with each other as long as your html document references the js and css documents. They need to be woven together to work.

There is a special html tag to identify JS:  

```
<script>FunctionName()</script>
```
