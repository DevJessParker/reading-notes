## How to Choose a Text Editor?

Here are some important features to consider when choosing a text editor:

**- Syntax Highlighting**
    - Does the editor display code in easy-to-read colors? This may help you separate important parts of commands and outputs not only for writing code but also for debugging issues.

**- Code Completion**
    - Does the editor offer suggestions to complete your code? This can help prevent typos and errors.

**- Themes**
    -Does the editor offer stylization options that increase usability?

**- Extensions**
    -Does the editor offer "apps" that broaden the scope of the editor's capabilities beyond the default settings?
