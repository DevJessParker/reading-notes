## How to Choose a Text Editor?

Here are some important features to consider when choosing a text editor:

**- Syntax Highlighting**
    - Does the editor display code in easy-to-read colors? This may help you separate important parts of commands and outputs not only for writing code but also for debugging issues.

**- Code Completion**
    - Does the editor offer suggestions to complete your code? This can help prevent typos and errors.

**- Themes**
    -Does the editor offer stylization options that increase usability?

**- Extensions**
    -Does the editor offer "apps" that broaden the scope of the editor's capabilities beyond the default settings?
    
    
## Anatomy of a Command Line

The following shows the breakdown of a basic command line:

## **prompt + command + argument = output**

## Navigating with Code

### Key Terms

Path | Describes how we get to a file or directory.

Absolute Path | Describes the location compared to the root system.

**Note: If you type cd but do not follow it with an argument, it will give you a shortcut back to the home directory.**

**Note: Relative Paths are identifiable by the forward slash.**

## Key Concepts: Files

1. Linux examines the file for content and disregards the .extension
2. There is a command **file \[path\]** that helps the user know what *type* of file we're working with
3. Aye Aye Cap! Linux is case sensitive, so be sure to watch your capitalization
4. Spaces in file names can cause ambiguity when it comes to arguments and paths. Be careful. If a file has a space, use < ' > marks around the name.
5. To hide a file, rename it with a < . > *The command **ls** will not list hidden files.*
