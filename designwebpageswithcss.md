## Breakdown of CSS Declaration

When applying CSS code, you have declarations made up of several parts that help define *how* you want your HTML element to appear on your web page. Let's look at the follow example and break it down.

```
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

**Example Breakdown**

Code | What it Means
------------ | ------------
p | This is a **selector.** It tells your browser what will be styled by the following **declaration**.
{ | This symbol signals the start of the **declaration.**
font-size: | This is the **property.** It explains *what* we're using CSS to change here. In this case, we're changing the font size of the paragraph.
16 | This is the **value**. We are telling the font size, or the **property**, exactly *how* to change.
px; | This is the unit used to define the **value** listed just before it.

> ***NOTE: Pay attention to the symbols and punctuations used. Where they occur matters to the CSS code.***
