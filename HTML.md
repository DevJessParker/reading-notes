## HTML Explained

**HTML** is a markup language used to organize *what* will be shown on a web page. It integrates with CSS, which is the language that will change *how* a wep page looks regarding style and appearance.


## Important HTML to Know

### \<!DOCTYPE html>
> This tells the browser which language to expect.

### \<html>\</html>
> This tag is used to encompass the \<header> and \<body>. It can be used to tell the browser *which* version of html to expect, although most browsers currently read in html5 as a standard.

### \<head>\</head>
> This area contains the meta data, browser tab page title, and SEO keywords for the page. **NOTE: This is different than a header.**

### \<body>\</body>
> This area contains \<header>, \<main>, and \<footer> elements.

### \<p>This denotes a paragraph\</p>
> Notice the **p** tag signals where a paragraph begins and ends.

### \<section>This denotes a section\</section>
> A section is often used to group related elements together. Think of a newspaper section and how it contains multiple types of content.

### \<article>This denotes an article\</article>
> An article can group related elements together much like a section. Articles can be nested inside of sections.

## Empty Attributes

Some attributes do not end with a closing tag. For example, an \<img> attribute only ends in a bracket **>**. These are called empty attributes.

Here is an example:

\<img src="FileName.jpg" alt="Description of File."\>

Notice the alt="Description of File."\>

The desciption is added to help assist visually impaired users understand the contents of the image. Accessibility of all users is an important consideration.
