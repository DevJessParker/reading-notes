# Programming with JS

## Function

A block of code that is told to perform certain tasks. It must be called before it will begin to run itself.

## Invoke

The signal for a document to pull the code for a given function. The symbol for a call/invoke is the parenthesis.

## Return Statement

Signals to JS to cease performing function.

## Why use functions?

- Reuse code.
- Define once and use code again.


> Variables with a function stay within that function. They are local. If a different function refers back to a variable used within an earlier function, the second function will not recognize the previously assigned value.
