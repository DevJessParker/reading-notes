Let's learn more about git, the coding revison procss, VCS, and ACP. First, let's start with defining these concepts.


## Key Term Definitions

Term | Definition
------------ | ------------
VCS | Software that allows developers to track changes.
git | A type of VCS.
commit | Command similar to "Save As"
commit message | A note developers leave that explains a change.
VS Code | A source-code editor
ACP | The code revision process of Add - Commit - Push

## Benefits of Git

- Version control allows us to track changes.
- Allows developers to collaborate on same project.
- Maintains history of changes.
- Keeps all files in the repository.
- Project safety and backup.


## Git Commands

There are several often-used git commands. Here, we'll list them along with their purpose and result.

### git clone pastlinkhere
> Downloads your current git from a given location or repository.

### git status
>Shows developer whether or not the latest coding changes to the git have been synced with the orginal location.

### git add filenamehere
> Transfers a change to the staging area to prepare for a commit command.

### git commit -m "Your commit message notes go here."
> Allows a developer to attach a commit message or note to the change. Acts as a "Save As" point.

### git push origin main
> Syncs local computer coding changes with a repository origin, such as GitHub.

## The ACP Process

As we know, **ACP stands for Add - Commit - Push**. Let's break this down futher so we can fully understand the revision cycle. It may be helpful to refer to the index of commands listed above.

1. **ADD**

When we use **git add pastlinkhere** we are downloading a repository or project to our local computer so that we may edit its code with our local editors.

2. **COMMIT**

When we use **git commit -m "Use this space to add your own change note"** we are essentially "Saving As" and adding a reference as to *what* was changed and *why it was changed.*

3. **PUSH**

When we use **git push origin main** we are signaling our local computer to send the changed code to its origin location. This syncs our local changes with where they will exist in the original repository.
