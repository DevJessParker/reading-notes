## Growth Mindset

To me, **Growth Mindset** is the ability to meet challenges as friends rather than foes. Obstacles give us the opportunity to troubleshoot issues on a deeper level, so that we may not only become stronger in our skillset, but also allow us the room to understand what *not* to do just as much as *what* to do. In a **Path Mindset**, we often skim the surface of the iceberg rather than understanding the current underneath. This leads to superficial knowledge, ***but not true understanding and comprehension.***


## Brain Hacks

- Reframe challenges as opportunity. **Embrace the Pit!**
- Never be satisfied with *"Good Enough."* There is always room for growth.
- Take constructive criticism as encouragement. Someone is taking the time to stengthen your skills.
