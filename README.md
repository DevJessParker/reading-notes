# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

This is my repository to track my notes for CodeFellows.

## About Me

My name is Jess Parker and I am transitioning to a software development career from a background in graphic design. I possess a BA in English Literature and taught rhetoric courses before I began working in book publishing. Currently, I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.

### Growth Mindset

To me **Growth Mindset** is the ability to meet challenges as friends rather than foes. Obstacles give us the opportunity to troubleshoot issues on a deeper level, so that we may not only become stronger in our skillset, but also allow us the room to understand what *not* to do just as much as *what to do*. In a Path Mindset, we often skim the surface of the iceberg rather than understanding the current underneath. This leads to superficial knowledge, ***but not true understanding and comprehension.***

### Brain Hacks

- Reframe challenges as opportunity. **Embrace the Pit!**
- Never be satisfied with *"Good Enough."* There is always room for growth.
- Be open minded
